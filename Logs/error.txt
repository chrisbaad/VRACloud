ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  expected ',' or '}', but got '<scalar>'

The error appears to be in '/etc/ansible/host_vars/100.127.146.103/vra_user_host_vars_e710509d-a521-44c1-96a6-c89e5f33a48f.yml': line 1, column 490, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
unbalanced quotes. If starting a value with a quote, make sure the
line ends with the same set of quotes. For instance this arbitrary
example:

    foo: "bad" "wolf"

Could be written as:

    foo: '"bad" "wolf"'
